LANGUAGE USED FOR SIMULATOR IS PYTHON.


SIMULATOR SUPPORTS FOLLOWING MIPS INSTRUCTIONS :- addi , add , sub , bne , beq , slt , sll , lw , sw , j , jr , jal , multu , mflo.


MEMORY  SUPPORT BY SIMULATOR IS 4KB.MEMORY IS AN ARRAY OF SIZE 1024.
ADDRESS OF MEMORY STARTS FROM 0x10010000 TO 0x10011000 AND INCREASE BY 4 FOR EVERY NEW ELEMENT.STACK POINTER sp ADDRESS STARTS FROM 0x10011000.


REGISTERS USED IN  SIMULATOR WITH THEIR INITIAL VALUES:-
registers = {'zero': 0, 'k1': 0, 'at': 0, 'v0': 0, 'v1': 0, 'a0': 3, 'a1': 0x7ffff6b4, 'a2': 0x7ffff6c4, 'a3': 0,
            't0': 0, 't1': 0,
            't2': 0, 't3': 0, 't4': 0, 't5': 0, 't6': 0,
            't7': 0, 's0': 0, 's1': 0, 's2': 0, 's3': 0, 's4': 0, 's5': 0, 's6': 0, 's7': 0, 't8': 0, 't9': 0, 'k0': 0, 'gp': 0x10008000, 'sp': 0x10011000, 's8': 0, 'ra': 0}


COMMENTS AND BLANK LINES ARE SUPPORTED BY SIMULATOR.


REGISTER $zero SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED USING INSTRUCTIONS.


PYTHON CODE or SIMULATOR WILL BE TAKING A ASSEMBLY FILE AS A INPUT 
AND SIMULATOR WILL BE EXECUTING ASSEMBLY FILE LINE BY LINE.


AVAILABLE ASSEMBLY FILES WILL BE FOR PROGRAMS LIKE QUICK_SORT , INSERTION_SORT , BUBBLE_SORT , FACTORIAL.
EVERYTIME WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR INPUT FILE NAME ACCORDING TO THE PROVIDED PROGRAM FILE NAMES IN THE SIMULATOR CODE. DEFAULT FILE WIIL BE OF QUICK_SORT ALGORITHM. IN FACTORIAL PROGRAM S3 REGISTER IS FACTORIAL(N).
