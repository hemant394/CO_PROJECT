	LANGUAGE USED FOR SIMULATOR IS PYTHON.

CO PHASE-2 :
IN THIS COPHASE-2.PY CODE WE HAVE INCORPORATED PIPELINING USING THE COPROJECT.PY WHICH WE MADE EARLIER .
AFTER EVERY INSTRUCTION OUR CODE WILL BE SHOWING THE CHANGES IN THE REGISTERS AND AFTER EXECUTING WHOLE ASSEMBLY FILE IT WILL BE SHOWING NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION AND NUMBER OF STALLS AND THE IPC(INSTRUCTION PER CYCLE).

WE NEED TO DOWNLOAD OTHER ASSEMBLY FILES AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE FILE ACCORDINGLY WHERE PYTHON CODE IMPORTS THOSE FILES WHICH NEEDS TO BE EXECUTE IN SIMULATOR.	

	

	SIMULATOR SUPPORTS FOLLOWING MIPS INSTRUCTIONS :- addi , add , sub , bne , beq , slt , sll , lw , sw , j , jr , jal , multu , mflo.
	

	

	MEMORY  SUPPORT BY SIMULATOR IS 4KB.MEMORY IS AN ARRAY OF SIZE 1024.
	ADDRESS OF MEMORY STARTS FROM 0x10010000 TO 0x10011000 AND INCREASE BY 4 FOR EVERY NEW ELEMENT.STACK POINTER sp ADDRESS STARTS FROM 0x10011000.
	

	

	REGISTERS USED IN  SIMULATOR WITH THEIR INITIAL VALUES:-
	registers = {'zero': 0, 'k1': 0, 'at': 0, 'v0': 0, 'v1': 0, 'a0': 3, 'a1': 0x7ffff6b4, 'a2': 0x7ffff6c4, 'a3': 0,
	            't0': 0, 't1': 0,
	            't2': 0, 't3': 0, 't4': 0, 't5': 0, 't6': 0,
	            't7': 0, 's0': 0, 's1': 0, 's2': 0, 's3': 0, 's4': 0, 's5': 0, 's6': 0, 's7': 0, 't8': 0, 't9': 0, 'k0': 0, 'gp': 0x10008000, 'sp': 0x10011000, 's8': 0, 'ra': 0}
	

	

	COMMENTS AND BLANK LINES ARE SUPPORTED BY SIMULATOR.
	

	

	REGISTER $zero SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED USING INSTRUCTIONS.
	

	

	PYTHON CODE or SIMULATOR WILL BE TAKING A ASSEMBLY FILE AS A INPUT 
	AND SIMULATOR WILL BE EXECUTING ASSEMBLY FILE LINE BY LINE.
	

	

	AVAILABLE ASSEMBLY FILES WILL BE FOR PROGRAMS LIKE QUICK_SORT , INSERTION_SORT , BUBBLE_SORT , FACTORIAL.
	EVERYTIME WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR INPUT FILE NAME ACCORDING TO THE PROVIDED PROGRAM FILE NAMES IN THE SIMULATOR CODE. DEFAULT FILE WIIL BE OF QUICK_SORT ALGORITHM. IN FACTORIAL PROGRAM S3 REGISTER IS FACTORIAL(N).
